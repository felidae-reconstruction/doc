**Analysis**

1. Synteny blocks and breakpoints
 * Feline-specific breakpoints
 * Grimm Synteny can not evaluate synteny for too many species (5-6 maximally)
 * Summarize the pieces of software for synteny blocks

* Evaluating synteny for improved comparative studies 10.1093/bioinformatics/btu259

 
2. Rearrangements
 * How to classify the rearrangements occured to the whole scaffolds
 * Try MGRA - ?
 * Most tools reconstruct the rearrangements __scenario___. It's hardly possible to check if the given scenario really took place. (It could be also multiple possible scenarios)

3. Constrained elements
 * Combine GERP, phastCons
 * Figure out why GERP is so slow
 * Search for regions related for Feline specific genetic deseases and check if they are conserved
 * ? Rate of core eucaryotic genes that fall into constrained regions
 * Now gene coverage was calculated as intersection with mRNA (~70% for phastCons), try intersect with exons (CDS) only

*Gene analysis* 
4. Gene evolution

5. Long non-coding RNAs

6. Pseudogenes

7. Traits
