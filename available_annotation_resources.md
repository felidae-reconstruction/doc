|---|---|---|---|---|
| mRNA | genBank | RNAseq | command-line connection to the UCSC database | don't use table browser |
| coding sequences (also pseudogenes) | ensemble | protein alignment + predictions |ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-80/fasta/felis_catus/ | use cdna, because cds are coding parts of exons|
|protein coding and non-coding sequences | RefSeq | mRNA derived form genBank data, alignment of this mRNA against the cat genome |  command-line connection to the UCSC database ||
